OpenWave-2KE is an open-source project. It's a simple python program that can get image or raw data from digital storage oscilloscope(GDS-2000E/DCS-2000E) via the USB port.  

Now we can execute the same source code on Windows, Linux(Ubuntu) and Raspbian(on Raspberry Pi 2) operating system without changing a word.


Equipment
------------
You have to get a new digital storage oscilloscope - GDS-2000E(GOOD WILL INSTRUMENT)/DCS-2000E(TEXIO) and a PC or NB with MS Windows OS.




Environment
------------
Currently OpenWave-2KE may be executed on Windows XP/7/8 32 or 64 bits OS. You have to download and install the USB driver(dso_vpo V1.08) from [www.gwinstek.com](http://www.gwinstek.com) or [here](/USB driver/dso_vpo_v108.zip) when the first connection with GDS-2000E. 

Please unzip the [OpenWave-2KE V1.01.zip](/Released/OpenWave-2KE V1.01.zip) and find the OpenWave-2KE.exe in the folder. OpenWave-2KE.exe can be executed directly without installation.

The OpenWave-2KE source code can also be executed on Ubuntu 32 bits Linux OS or Raspbian OS(on Raspberry Pi 2). The USB driver is not required in this environment.


Development Tools
------------
- **Packages:**
   If you want to modify the source code and run the program by yourself. You have to install the development tools and packages as following:
   * Python 2.7.6
